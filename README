The Scheme files in bootstrap/scheme depend on guile+whatever.
When linked against Guile 2.x, guile+whatever should always be called *with* the option
--no-auto-compile .

guile+whatever should always be called from the directory
bootstrap/scheme -- hence *not* from the directory where its compiled
executable file resides.

From guile+whatever (using the load procedure or from the shell
command line), you can load:

* bootstrap.scm
* quick-start.scm (same effect as bootstrap.scm but faster, using exec: it
                   only works after bootstrap.scm has been run with success:
                   bootstrap.scm also does unexec during startup)


epsilon1
--------
bootstrap.scm and quick-start.scm do not load the epsilon1 REPL, but
epsilon1 expressions can be evaluated with the macro e1:toplevel.  For example:

  (e1:toplevel (cons:cons 1 2))

will return a whatever cons.
